In the second commit of this programme, there will be some minor changes for user-friendliness' sake.
I removed the user input prompt that went on an on and stuck to a desired range. To achieve this I introduced a counter under the while loop. This helped me ensure that
the programme stopped after a desired amount of iterations.
I added a different function for the first five numbers I wanted to randomise and one for the powerball.Both these have different ranges. The 'first five' numbers range from 
1 to 50 , The 'powerball range' starts at 1 and ends at 20.
Now , instead of continously asking for input, it will generate five numbers and the powerball without a hassle.
